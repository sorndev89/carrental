## Project Analysis Request: Car Rental System Development

**Objective:** Analyze the provided information for a "Car Rental System" project and offer insights, potential improvements, or considerations from a Full Stack Web Developer perspective.

---

### Project Overview:

The goal is to build a comprehensive Car Rental System that serves both customers and administrators. The system aims to streamline the car rental process, from booking and payment to vehicle and user management, and financial tracking.

---

### Key Features and Functionality:

**1. Customer-facing (Front-end):**
    * **Car Selection & Booking:** Customers can browse, search (by car type, availability, location), and select cars. They can choose booking plans, pickup/return dates, and locations.
    * **Booking Confirmation & Payment:** Upon booking, the system displays a QR code for payment.
    * **Payment Notification:** Customers can notify the system after making a payment.
    * **Login via Phone Number:** Customers can log in using their phone number (likely via OTP for security).
    * **Booking History & Status:** Logged-in customers can view their booking history and payment status.
    * **Personal Profile:** Access to their personal information, limited to non-admin data.
    * **Strict Access Control:** Customers are explicitly prevented from accessing any back-end or administrative functionalities.

**2. Administrator-facing (Back-end):**
    * **User Management:** Add, edit, delete users (both customers and staff), and define user roles/permissions.
    * **Booking Management:** Track latest bookings, confirm bookings, and verify payments.
    * **Car Management:** Add, edit, delete car details (including car types).
    * **Driver Management:** Manage driver information (if "car with driver" service is offered).
    * **Income & Expense Tracking:** Record all financial transactions (income from bookings, various expenses).
    * **Reporting System:** Generate essential reports for business analysis (see "Required Reports" section below).
    * **Login Segregation:** Administrators/staff log in separately (e.g., via email/password) and have access to back-end functionalities based on their assigned roles.
